### a. What is AMQP?

AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is a protocol used for sending messages between systems in a reliable, secure, and asynchronous way. AMQP is often used in message brokers like RabbitMQ to allow different services or applications to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages through queues.

### b. What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672

This is a connection string used to connect to a RabbitMQ server. The first `guest` is the username, the second `guest` is the password, and `localhost:5672` means the RabbitMQ server is running locally (on the same machine) and is listening on port `5672`, which is the default port for AMQP connections.
